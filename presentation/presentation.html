      leading partnerships with external AWS customer organizations, 
      usually mid to large-sized companies. These partnerships aim to identify, develop, 
      and evaluate cutting-edge solutions using generative AI technologies for critical 
      business functions. With more than eight years of experience in machine learning and
      contributions to over 30 research publications in prestigious conferences like AAAI,
      ACL, CVPR, NeurIPS, and EACL, her work spans a range of topics. These include Large
      Scale Graph Neural Networks, Machine Translation, Multimodal Summarization, and the
      exploration of Social Media and Networks, Human-Centric ML, Artificial Social Intelligence,
      and Code-Mixing. In addition to her professional work, Aishwarya has been involved in mentoring
      several Master's and PhD students in the aforementioned areas. Aishwarya has also designed multiple
      online courses covering Generative AI concepts, which have drawn in over 3,000 students.
      Additionally, she frequently shares simplified insights on complex generative AI research on
      LinkedIn, making it easier for more people to understand and use.
